# ELIXIR Implementation Study "Comparison, benchmarking and dissemination of proteomics data analysis pipelines"
See also https://elixir-europe.org/about-us/commissioned-services/proteomics-pipelines

The aim of this study is to create different pipelines for the analysis of label-free proteomics data and systematically compare their results. If possible, the workflows are implemented in [NextFlow](https://www.nextflow.io/) to allow reproducible results and scalable execution on different computer architectures.

### File structure of repository
For examples and simple templates containing e.g. a workflow for file conversion (Thermo raw -> mgf), see https://github.com/veitveit/IS_Benchmarking/tree/master/Examples_and_templates

Each of the different workflows is represented by a folder containing the subfolders "NextFlow
