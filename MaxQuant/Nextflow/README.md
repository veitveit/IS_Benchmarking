# Workflow to analyze label-free data with MaxQuant
This workflow is based on a docker image which has to be created beforehand: exaexa:maxquant

## Getting started

This script assumes that Docker is available on your system and is targeting Debian/Ubuntu linux distributions.

This workflow is not so far implemented in Nextflow as it does not use more than one tool

## Run benchmarking data set

Download the raw files from PRIDE: http://proteomecentral.proteomexchange.org/cgi/GetDataset?ID=PXD001819

Run the workflow with the following command and parameters after  
a) changing _RAWFOLDER_ to the folder where the raw files are located.   
b) placing the parameter file _mqpar_LFW_PXD001819.xml_ into in the current folder  
c) chang√≠ng the paths of both fasta file and the raw files in the maxquant parameter file. 

The parameter file is given in the Results folder of this workflow: https://github.com/veitveit/IS_Benchmarking/edit/master/MaxQuant/Results

The outputfiles will be written into _RAWFOLDER_


```
docker run -it --rm -v ${PWD}:/import -v RAWFOLDER:/input_raw veitveit/maxquant:dev bash  -c 'cd /import; maxquant  mqpar_LFQ_PXD001819.xml'
```
